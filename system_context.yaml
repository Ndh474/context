          "2. Read Configuration: The job reads the value of 'attendance.evidence_retention_days' from system_configurations (e.g., 30 days).",
          "3. Scan for Old Regular Evidence: The job queries the 'regular_attendance_evidences' table to find all records older than the retention period.",

        ]

    face_identification_flow: "When a lecturer starts a scan session, the system retrieves the student list and assigned cameras. The Python service processes video streams and calls the Backend API to record results. For each scan, the system processes the result based on the student's current state (see 'face_recognition.outcomes' logic): 1) A 'No Match' on a 'Present' student will revert their status to 'Not Yet'. 2) A 'Match' on a 'Not Yet' student will update their evidence image but keep their status as 'Not Yet'. The system adds relevant events to the student's history record. This process does not overwrite old data."

    data_export_flow: "This is a manual flow performed by Data Operator. The user accesses the 'Data Export' screen on the Admin Portal, selects data type (e.g., attendance results), file format (CSV, JSON), and necessary filters. The system then generates the file and allows the user to download it for import into external systems like SIS/LMS."

    authentication_flow: "Users on all platforms (Web, Mobile) can log in with Google. Upon successful authentication, Google provides an email address. The FUACS system uses this email address to directly look up the corresponding user account that already exists in the system. If an active account with a matching email is found, the system grants a session token with the permissions assigned to that user. This flow is entirely based on email matching."

    system_notification_flow: "When a business event occurs (e.g., identity rejection), the system generates notification content (hardcoded in backend), creates a notification record and delivery record for the target user, and sends a push notification."

    username_password_auth_flow: "User enters username and password. Backend finds user by username, then uses a hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to compare the entered password with the password_hash stored in the database. If matched, grants session token."

    password_reset_flow: "User enters email. System creates a unique, time-limited reset token, saves it to the database, and sends an email containing the reset link. When the user accesses the link, the system validates the token, allows them to enter a new password, hashes and updates the password_hash, then invalidates the used token."

        - "2. Read Configuration: The job first reads the value of 'attendance.max_absence_percentage' from the system_configurations table to get the current threshold."
        - "3. Scan for Completed Slots: The job queries the database to find all lecture slots (slot_category IN ('LECTURE', 'LECTURE_WITH_PT')) that have ended within the previous calendar day (where end_time is between 00:00:00 and 23:59:59 of previous day)."
        - "4. Recalculate Absence Rates: For each class associated with the found slots, the job recalculates the current absence percentage for every enrolled student."
