## ‚ö†Ô∏è NEED REVIEW IN FUTURE

### üîç Endpoints Marked as "Completed" - Need Verification

These endpoints are marked as completed but should be reviewed/tested to ensure full implementation:

#### Authentication & User Management
- [ ] **Review**: Google OAuth integration - verify token validation and user creation flow
- [ ] **Review**: Password reset email sending - check email service integration
- [ ] **Review**: JWT token refresh mechanism - may need additional endpoint

#### Roles & Permissions
- [ ] **Review**: Role-permission mapping update - verify cascade effects on active users
- [ ] **Review**: Permission enforcement middleware - test all permission checks

#### Slots
- [ ] **Review**: `/slots/{id}/start-session` - verify Python service integration
- [ ] **Review**: `/slots/{id}/finalize` - test finalization rules and batch status updates
- [ ] **Review**: `/slots/{id}/roster` - verify real-time attendance status updates

#### Student/Staff Profiles
- [ ] **Review**: Bulk operations performance - test with large datasets
- [ ] **Review**: Profile deletion - verify cascade delete behavior with enrollments/attendance

#### Classes
- [ ] **Review**: `/classes/{id}/slots` - verify filtering and sorting work correctly
- [ ] **Review**: Class deactivation - test constraint checks for active slots/enrollments

### üîß Missing Endpoints in Completed Groups
