notes:
  - "Each room can have multiple cameras for comprehensive coverage"
  - "RTSP URLs must be unique to prevent conflicts in video stream access"
  - "All active cameras in a room are automatically used for slots in that room"
  - "Camera assignment is determined at runtime: SELECT * FROM cameras WHERE room_id = slot.room_id AND is_active = true"
