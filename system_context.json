When session stops, all remaining 'not_yet' auto-finalize to 'absent' (SYSTEM_FINALIZE). 2) RESCAN in regular sessions: Status FROZEN - no auto status changes. Detected students get evidence updated only. After stop: 'present' not detected get needsReview=true (suspect early leave), 'absent' detected get needsReview=true (marking conflict). Lecturer must manually review flagged records. 3) RESCAN in exam sessions: AUTO-PROMOTE detected 'absent' students to 'present' (handles late arrivals).
