Key behaviors: 1) First scan: All scanned students become 'present' with evidence image. 2) Rescan in regular sessions: Scanned 'not_yet' students remain 'not_yet' with evidence captured (requiring manual approval); 'present' students not scanned revert to 'not_yet' with old evidence kept for review. 3) Rescan in exam sessions: Scanned 'not_yet' students are automatically promoted to 'present' with evidence captured; 'present' students not scanned remain 'present'.
